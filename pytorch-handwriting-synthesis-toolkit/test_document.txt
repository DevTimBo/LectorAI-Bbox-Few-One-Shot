This is a text file used as input to the handwriting generation command.
 The command will split the text into lines.
 Then it will generate handwriting images for every line and concatenate them into a single image.
 Finally, the image will be saved in a specified path.
 Consistent style across the whole page is achieved by priming the network with the handwriting of the first line.
